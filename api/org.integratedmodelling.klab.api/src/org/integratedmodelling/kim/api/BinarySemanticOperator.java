/**
 * Connectors for concepts that are linked in expressions. These can be chained. Besides the
 * standard AND (@link {@link #UNION}) and OR (@link {@link #INTERSECTION}) we have, for now, (@link
 * {@link #FOLLOWS}) that creates an event made up of two consecutive events. We do not allow a
 * negation operator as deniability is handled elsewhere.
 * 
 * More work needs to be done to ensure correct interpretation of unions and intersections,
 * particularly to recognize a duality that is due to observational issues such as scale or
 * uncertainty vs. phenomenology. We may eventually provide different operators to distinguish
 * different cases.
