/**
 * A IResource represents non-semantic information content that is identified by a URN and can be
 * processed semantically through a worldview. k.LAB provides methods to resolve a URN into a
 * IResource and to retrieve the data content, in a separate operation to optimize speed. The
 * services available on a k.LAB node allow to upload resources in the form of files, literals, or
 * URLs for services, and make their content available under a URN that becomes a secure endpoint
 * for their use in semantic engines.
 * <p>
 * Data services implemented in a k.LAB node allow bridging to multiple types of resources, linking
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.data.adapters.IResourceAdapter} plug-ins to a resource
 * type expressed as a string. Each plug-in exposes a
 * ({@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.data.adapters.IResourceValidator} validator), a
 * ({@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.data.adapters.IResourcePublisher} publisher/unpublisher)
 * and an ({@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.data.adapters.IResourceEncoder} encoder) for each
 * new resource type supported. IResources have a
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.data.IGeometry} that can be turned into a semantic
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.observations.scale.IScale} through a
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.knowledge.IWorldview}. This way, engines do not need to
 * know the details of any specific data protocol as the contents are returned from the engine in
 * encoded form upon a request for a URN's contents in a compatible scale.
 * <p>
 * Resolution of a URN (operated by the configured
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.services.IResourceService} returns a IResource, which can
 * be coupled with a {@link IGeometry} to yield an immutable {@link IKlabData artifact} that a
 * semantic {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.model.IModel} can process into an
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.observations.IObservation}.
