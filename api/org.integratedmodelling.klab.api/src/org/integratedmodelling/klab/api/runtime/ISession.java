/**
 * Any observation made in k.LAB must be done within a valid user session.
 * Sessions are obtained from a running {@link IEngine} using
 * {@link IEngine#createSession()} or
 * {@link IEngine#createSession(IEngineUserIdentity)}.
 * <p>
 * Sessions must be properly closed when not needed anymore. A ISession is a
 * {@link java.io.Closeable}, so a typical usage is
 *
 * <pre>
 * try (ISession session = engine.createSession()) {
 * 	// do things
 * } catch (KlabException e) {

 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * A session is also an {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.auth.IIdentity},
 * and its token must authenticate those engine API calls that are
 * session-aware. All sessions have a {@link IUserIdentity} as parent.
 * <p>
 * If a session has a behavior associated (bound in the connection REST call by 
 * name), it becomes an actor and implements it by setting priorities, views and
 * whatever else the behavior specifies.
