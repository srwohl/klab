/**
 * A {@code ICoverage} A coverage is a scale that keeps information about how much of its extents is
 * being covered by other extents. Coverage is initialized at 0 or 1 and can be modified only by
 * merging in conformant scales. It represents the total coverage for an observation or a
 * computation during or after resolution. Merge operations do not change the underlying scale but
 * will modify the fraction of the original extents that is covered.
 * <p>
 * A {@code ICoverage} redefines the
 * {@link org.integratedmodelling.klab.api.observations.scale.IScale#merge(ITopologicallyComparable, LogicalConnector)}
 * method to only perform a union when the resulting coverage adds enough coverage. The
 * {@link #getGain()} can be called on the result to check if the merge produced any significant
 * increment or decrement in coverage.
 * <p>
 * Due to the reinterpretation of the meaning of merging, it is essential that a coverage is not
 * used as a scale when merging is involved. Implementations should provide type safety through
 * using explicit types and not interfaces in crucial APIs.
 * <p>
