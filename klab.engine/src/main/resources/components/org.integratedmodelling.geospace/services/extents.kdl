spatialextent space
	"Generates spatial geographical extents to use in observations or to constrain models. Parameters
	 enable the creation of single shapes using WKT and WKB notation, as well as regular grids and
	 irregular spatial tessellations with shape masks."
{
	
	optional text enumeration
		"An authority providing an enumerated view of space, where each spatial tessellation is 
		 identified only by a code. Using this parameter deactivates all
		 others and turns off almost every other spatial functionalities in k.LAB."

	optional text shape
		"A string containing the WKT or WKB definition of a geographical shape, optionally 
		 prefixed with the EPSG projection code including the authority (the default projection
		 is 'EPSG:4326')."
	    default ""
	
	optional value grid 
		"The linear resolution of the desired grid as a number with length units. Example: 1.km. A string 
		 like '1 km' can also be passed."
		
	optional text urn
		"A URN (or a string specifying one) that will return at least one spatial object, whose
		 spatial context will be used as a return value."
		default ""
		
	optional text projection
		"A string that specify the EPSG code for a projection to use instead of the original
		 one when shapes come from a URN."
		default ""		
		
	optional number simplify
		"A distance in projection units that will force simplification of polygons and other shapes
		 by assuming that points within that distance can be ignored."
